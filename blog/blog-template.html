<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	-Creating a wireframe with my pair was a reassuring experience as it allowed us to see that we had the same basic concepts in mind. We first showed each other what we thought our own initial homepages should look like, then worked together to develop a wireframe for an individual blog post. I drew the initial sketch while we both thought out loud. We then moved on to developing the HTML page, my pair driving as I navigated. Overall is was a very good experience.

	Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
	Wireframing made the HTML write-up process go very smoothly. In terms of pairing, it served as a helpful reference for previously agreed terms while also letting us discover that some of the site's structure could be reconsidered. 

	What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
	We agreed that the wireframe for an individual blog post should be very simple. Overall, we concurred that the page should serve to host the individual blog post while still allowing the reader to navigate to other areas of the blog site. The function of the page should be to present primarily the title, date, and content of that individual blog post. On the top of the page should be the blog's name with links back to the home page and contact page. At the bottom we decided there should be navigation links leading to previous or newer blog posts. The wireframe mapped all of this out in its simplest forms.

	What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? 
	I had not implemented divs yet in Phase 0, and my pair was able to demonstrate to me the usefulness of this tag and showing me how other sections of html could be nested comfortably within them.
