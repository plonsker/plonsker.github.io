  <h2>Introduction to the General Concepts of The Command Line and Version Control, by Joe Plonsker</h2>

  <section>
  <h4>Greetings</h4>
    <p>
      Greetings and welcome to a beginner's orientation on the concept of Git. With a few powerful tools, you will be able to create and upload web files for all the world to see. As you dive further into this topic later on, you may discover that the workflow might not come as easily as you had previously hoped. Oftentimes you might find yourself banging your head against a wall only to notice a door a few feet away. Patience and research are key during this time. For now, let us take a look at the general operation of Git. 
    </p>
    <h4>The Command Line</h4>
    <p>
      Think about all the actions you do on your computer using its graphic interface. You can use your mouse to open files, create documents, drag folders around, etc. Now imagine doing the majority of commands in a fraction of the time by typing in a few keywords. This is essentially what a command line interface allows you to do. In case you are unfamiliar with the command line interface on your machine, it is a simple black box resembling what a computer in the 90's looked like upon startup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actions you commit via the command line terminal and the actions you take by clicking around your machine's interface are just different ways of interacting with the same system. Keep this in mind as you teach yourself the basic commands. For example, when you type in a command like mkdir (make directory), think about how you would typically interact with your machine to perform the same function. As you continue to teach yourself more commands, you will begin to appreciate the speed and agility with which you can navigate your system, move folders, or create files. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What's important to keep in mind when writing actions on the command line is that with great ease comes great opportunities to make computer-altering mistakes. Rarely will commands you type in be greeted with a warning. If a warning or error message presents itself, take the time to try to understand what exactly your computer it attempting to say to you. Attention to detail is key here. Make sure you are always targeting the right directory or file before going any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The command line terminal is not only for interacting with your machine. You can use it to push projects you have made into the world for all to see! This will be addressed in the next two sections.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Git and the importance of Version Control</h4>
    
    <p>
      Git is a version control system for coding projects and software development. Before we can talk about Git and its relation to the command line terminal, we have to talk about what a version control system is. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Essentially a version control system is the means by which every revision of a project's components are tracked for every contributor to see. Imagine an author keeping various manuscripts of one work, each version detailing where a specific change was made through time. A version control system for software development is a step above that, explicitly outlining every change, showing the content of a previous version, and even requiring review by team members before it can go live.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several reasons for why version control is crucial in development. As noted before, many contributors can be working on multiple parts of a single project at once. Many of these components hinge on each other to keep the whole system going. Imagine if suddenly most parts of the project stopped working and the root cause had to be tracked down. With a version control system, a teammate can see what recent changes were made in the programâ€™s blueprint, figure out how it is impacting the overall system, and make any necessary modifications. It is a means by which developers can quickly get a diagnosis on what is causing the symptoms to be treated. Furthermore, version control often requires peer review before changes go live. It is essentially a checkpoint to catch anything that needs to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a version control system specific to software development. In relation to your command line terminal, it is a program that gives you the power to make and track changes on a project with a few simple commands. Git keeps track of the changes you make by pinpointing when and where they were done. This history of your work can be accessed through your command line terminal using specific Git commands. For simplicity's sake, it is best to use Git bash, the simple terminal you can download along with the Git program. 
    </p>

    <h4>Github: where version control and group projects come together</h4>
    <p>
      Earlier in the previous section I described how version control was essential to projects as it established work history and its impact. Github is where the tools of Git can manifest themselves to establish accountability for actions within a project. While the tools of Git live locally in your computer, Github is the means by which your teammates or the general public can see the changes you have made. Github also operates as the platform through which your teammates can review changes you want to make to software.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I apologize if you have read the past few sentences over and over again. Do not worry. This can be made a bit clearer by reestablishing the function of each of our essential platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Command line terminal: the interface through which you can navigate through and make changes to files in your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git: The system by which certain changes are logged for reference. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Github: The online platform through which certain changes that were logged by git are made visible to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how are all three connected? Using specific Git commands through the command line terminal, you can make and track changes to a file on your machine and then push them through to Github.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git resides in your machine. Github resides on the internet for all to see. In order to have your teammates see the changes you have made, you must explicitly make a connection to Github through your terminal using specific Git commands. Your computer is only as smart as the commands you give it!
    </p>

    <h4>In Sum</h4>
    <p>
      The command line terminal is the interface by which you run certain operations on your machine. Git is the version control software through which particular operations can be historically tracked and pushed into existence. Git is used through specific git commands in the command line terminal. Github is the cloud-based system (or simply put, website) through which changes to a file or project can be pushed through for others to see. Those changes can be pushed by making an explicit connection to the site through the terminal using Git commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep these general concepts of the systems when working through the smaller steps. Remember that the overall goal is to create and make changes in software while sharing them with teammates. These components all work together to make that possible.
