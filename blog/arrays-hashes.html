			<h4>Introduction to Arrays and Hashes in Ruby</h4>
			<h6>November 15, 2015</h6>

				<p>
				There are two kinds of lists used to store data in the Ruby language: arrays and hashes. Both are used for keeping and retrieving data, but have different overall functions.
				</p>
				<p>
				Arrays are ordered and indexed lists of objects. This list of objects is kept within square brackets with each object separated by a comma. An array can contain integers, strings, or both.
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				[1, 7, 6, 42]
				["Dog", "Cat", "Bird", "Mouse"]
				["seven", "horse", 1568, "thirty"]
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				Arrays are indexed with integers, meaning that they have an integer associated with their position in the list. This is useful as it allows one to access certain things in an array. For example, let say we have an array of the primary colors red, blue, and yellow titled 'primary_colors'.
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				primary_colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow"]
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				If we wished to access the second color in the list, we would simply call that variable and ask it what color is listed second. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				primary_colors[1]
				=>"blue"
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				Why on earth though would we call the second color by using the number 1? The answer is that Ruby begins counting from 0 with arrays. So if we were to access the first color on the list, we would type out 
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				primary_colors[0]
				=> "red"
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				If we wished to access the last color in this list, we could write out primary_colors[2]. But what about for lists where we don't know how many items are in the array and we simply wished to access the last one? No need to worry, since we can just access by typing in primary_colors[-1]. Not only does Ruby start counting from zero, but it can also count backwards to access elements in an array. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				primary_colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow"]

				primary_colors[-1]
				=>"yellow"
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				You can also determine how many elements are in an array by calling the length method on it.
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				primary_colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow"]

				primary_colors.length
				=>3
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				Arrays are not only helpful for keeping lists of items but also for making it easier to run particular Ruby methods or blocks to all elements in that array. Say we have an array of integers and want to multiply each item in array by itself.
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				integer_array = [1, 3, 5, 7]

				my_array.each {|i| puts i*i}

				1
				9
				25
				49
				=> [1, 3, 5, 7]
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				Arrays allow us to do a few processes with as much information as we want in a concise manner.
				</p>
				<p>
				Hashes are lists of elements paired with keys to their assigned place instead of an integer. Hashes are bound within curly brackets instead of square ones. Here's a list of some musical genres with associated acts 
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				music = {
					"Slayer" => "Metal",
					"Crass" => "Punk",
					"Wagner" => "Classical"
				}
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				The keys here are the musical acts, and the values are their genres. You can call a musical act to discover it genre. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				music = {
					"Slayer" => "Metal",
					"Crass" => "Punk",
					"Wagner" => "Classical"
				}
				
				puts music["Slayer"]
				=>Metal
				</p>
				</pre>
				<p>
				Hashes are particularly useful because they can store information that can be accessed with a simple keyword. Think of looking up a word in a dictionary. The whole dictionary would be a hash containing words and their definitions. You can then type in a key, which in this case would be the word you are looking up. The value of that key would be the definition which is then brought back.
				</p>
				<p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				dictionary = {
					"cow" => "large domesticated ungulate",
					"hippopotamus" => "a mostly herbivorous mammal in sub-Saharan Africa",
					"Zebra" => "African equid"

				}

				puts dictionary ["hippopotamus"]
				=>a mostly herbivorous mammal in sub-Saharan Africa
				</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				As you can probably tell from the example above, keys must be unique for different values. If one were to have two entries for the same word but with different definitions, only the definition towards the end of the hash would get printed. It is a best practice to make sure all keys are unique. 

				In sum, arrays and hashes are both kinds of lists in Ruby. While arrays are simple lists that can have their elements accessed by integers, hashes are lists that can have their elements accessed by assigned keys.
