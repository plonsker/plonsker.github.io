			<h4>Brief Introduction to Recursion</h4>

				<p>
				As a Ruby beginner, you should know that methods are reusable sections of code, and that you can call at certain times to perform certain functions. Perhaps though in your early work with Ruby you have run into a situation where a method you created broke your terminal because it was running infinitely. Such accidents are a good introduction to the world of recursion and for preventing incidents like this in the future. 
				</p>

				<p>Recursion is where a certain problem is solved by multiple, smaller versions of that same problem are played out for a certain period. In order to do this, the method calls itself. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Check out the following method that subtracts one from number until it hits zero. 
				</p>
				<pre>
				def sub_one(num)
  					puts num
  					if num > 0
    				sub_one(num - 1)
  					end
				end

				sub_one(20)
				</pre>
				<p>
				Here the method calls itself within itself in order to pass a precise argument to itself. Already sounds a bit conceptually recursive, right? Why would a method need to call itself? The reason is that if the method does not call itself and continues to attempt to solve a problem by continuously breaking that problem into smaller instances, it will keep repeating that same basic function forever. What the method must do is call itself and give itself a limit. That limit is called the base case. In our earlier method, you can look at the if statement as the the base case as it is the limit we have set for ourselves. Without it, the method would continue to subtract one forever and ever. Recursive functions will send you into an endless void if you are not careful. Consider <a href="https://youtu.be/et_MmlTxMXA?t=10s">this video as a demonstration of a method called ‘play_botton’</a> that has no base case.
				</p>

				In practice, it is best to go with iteration instead of recursion as it is more straightforward. However recursion seems to be a common theme in multiple languages and interviews. An engineer at my old job used the following gif to describe an interview candidate who made a recursive method but forgot the base case:

				The concept itself is important for understanding how computers will perform certain operations by how you describe those operations to them. They can only do what they are told. If they are told to perform an operation without being told when to stop, they will not stop until they break.
