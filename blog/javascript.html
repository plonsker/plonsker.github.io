			<h4>Brief Introduction to Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects</h4>
			<h6>December 6, 2015</h6>
			<div class="hr"></div>
				<p>
				Ruby and JavaScript both have their own types of lists with values we can access. In fact, the syntax of each look nearly identical. I will do my best to explain the nuances here. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Take a look at the following Ruby hash:
				</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				pets = { 'dog'=> 'Spot', 'cat' => 'Roy', 'fish'=> 'Wanda'}
				</pre>
				<p>
				We have a hash called ‘pets’ that contains the types of pets as keys and the names of each pet as values. We can iterate through the hash, call up some key and value pairs, or simply call individual keys or values. This hash can also be written in the following manner:
				</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
				pets = { dog: 'Spot', cat: 'Roy', fish: 'Wanda'}
				</pre>
				<p>
				Now take a look at the same list as a JavaScript object:
				</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint javascript">
				var pets = { dog: 'Spot', cat: 'Roy', fish: 'Wanda'}
				</pre>
				<p>
				The whole object is a declared variable in JS. What were keys in the Ruby hash are now JS properties, and what were values are now known as property values. One can access the properties of a JS object by calling them in two ways. If you wished to get the dog, you can either call pets.dog or pets["dog"]. Probably the best way to think about how the two are different from each other is that Ruby considers a hash as simply a list while JS thinks of the object as just one object with many attributes and characteristics. Functionally though, they appear to perform most of the same functions.
