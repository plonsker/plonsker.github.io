			<h4>Revisting My Site</h4>
			<h6>December 18, 2015</h6>
			<div class="hr"></div>
				<p>
				These past few weeks have made me realize once again that while I enjoy art and making beautiful things, I find more joy doing backend work than frontend work when it comes to coding. I get more of a kick from a well-crafted ruby method than an aesthetically pleasing web interface. This might change though if I make my site into something that presents photographs I have taken or music I've made instead of a CV.
				</p>
				<p>
				This week I took some time to fix some basic things:
				<ul>
				<li>Turn everything to grayscale, as I tend to think in black and white and it keeps everything simple</li>
				<li>Fix broken links</li>
				<li>Change fonts and general design to something not as aggressive</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				That's really it for now. I do not think I can rush into making an entirely new site. What I think is best is to take an hour each day just to alter a few things at a time. I'm still trying to figure out how to maintain the simple aesthetics of the web 1.0 world without it being too boring.
