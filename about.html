Greetings,
<p>
<p>
Call me Joe.
</p>
<p>
This is my personal site. It was built with the intent of showing my appreciation of minimalist design. 
</p>
<p>
I am a software engineer and tech support specialist residing in New York City. I am a member of the Chartcorp team at Chartbeat.
</p>

<p>
I attended St. John's College in Santa Fe, NM, studying Philosophy and Mathematics through the Great Books Program.
</p>

<p>
I worked at Berkeley Law for a while before entering the tech scene as a contractor doing data curation and analysis at Apartment List. I then went on to work as a contractor at Google for two years working on operations and expansion for Google Express.
</p>

<p>
While at Google, I became inspired by the challenges the engineers faced in building new technologies and decided that I should learn to build software applications. During the spring and summer of 2015, I spent nights and weekends teaching myself how to code. Eventually I applied to DBC in order to learn how to build web applications. My career change took approximately one year. If you are reading this and considering a similar career change, feel free to reach out to me to get the gist on what it takes to pull through.
</p>

<p>
As someone who grew up in San Francisco, I have seen firsthand how the rise in tech has correlated with a rise in social and economic inequality. I believe that many of issues diagnosed within the tech community can be solved through positive action. I hope to help combat this imbalance by empowering those who have not had the same opportunities I have had. 
</p>
<p>
I enjoy street photography, underground music, weightlifting, music production, and modern philosophy.
