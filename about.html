    Greetings,
    </p>
    <p>
    Call me Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is my personal site. As you can probably tell, I have an appreciation for minimalist design. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I am a software developer and technology analyst residing in New York City. I am a member of the Chartcorps team at <a href="https://chartbeat.com/" target="_blank">Chartbeat</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    I attended <a href="http://www.sjc.edu/" target="_blank">St. John's College</a> in Santa Fe, NM, studying Philosophy and Mathematics through <a href="http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts/" target="_blank">the Great Books Program</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    I worked at <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Law</a> for a while before entering the tech scene as a contractor doing data curation and analysis at <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/" target="_blank">Apartment List</a>. I then went on to work as a contractor at Google for two years working on operations and expansion for <a href="https://www.google.com/express/" target="_blank">Google Express</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    While at Google, I became inspired by the challenges the engineers faced in building new technologies and decided that I should learn to build software applications. During the spring and summer of 2015, I spent nights and weekends teaching myself how to code. Eventually I applied to <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">DBC</a> in order to learn how to build web applications. 
    </p>

    <p>My career change took approximately one year. If you are reading this and considering a similar career change, feel free to <a href="mailto:joe@plonsker.com">email me</a> with any questions.
    </p>

    <p>
    As someone who grew up in San Francisco, I have seen firsthand how the rise in tech has correlated with a rise in social and economic inequality. I believe that many of issues diagnosed within the tech community can be solved through positive action. I hope to help combat this imbalance by supporting and empowering those who have not had the same opportunities I have had. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I enjoy street photography, underground music, weightlifting, music production, and modern philosophy.
