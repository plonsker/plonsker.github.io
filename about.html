Greetings,
</p>
<p>
I am Joe, and this is my personal site. It was built with the intent of showing my appreciation of minimalist design. 
</p>



<p>
I am a software engineer and tech support specialist residing in New York City. I work as a tech support representative at Chartbeat.
</p>

<p>
I attended <a href="http://www.sjc.edu/">St. John's College in Santa Fe, NM</a>, studying Philosophy and Mathematics through <a href="http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/liberal-arts/">the Great Books Program</a>.
</p>

<p>
I worked at <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Law</a> for a while before entering the tech scene as a contractor doing data curation and analysis at <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/">Apartment List</a>. I then went on to work as a contractor at Google for two years working on operations and expansion for <a href="https://www.google.com/express/">Google Express</a>.
</p>

<p>
While at Google, I became inspired by the challenges the engineers faced in building new technologies and decided that I should learn to build software applications. During the spring and summer of 2015, I spent nights and weekends teaching myself how to code. Eventually I applied to <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DBC</a> in order to learn how to build web applications. My career change took approximately one year. If you are reading this and considering a similar career change and want to get an idea of what my experience was like, feel free to reach out to me via one of the contact forms listed below.
</p>

<p>
As someone who grew up in San Francisco, I have seen the correlation between the rise in tech and the rise in socio-economic inequality. It is a sensitive topic, but I believe that many of the issues associated with tech culture can be changed through positive action. I plan to do my part by supporting and empowering those who have not had the same opportunities I have had. 
</p>
<p>
I enjoy street photography, underground music, weightlifting, music production, and modern philosophy.
