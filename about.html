	    <h2>About</h2>
	    		<div id="content">
	    		<p>I grew up in San Francisco and relocated to New York a couple of years ago to work on an operations project at Google. During my time there I became fascinated with the work the engineers were doing and appreciated the culture they created, so I decided web development was a decent career change.

	    		<p>
	    		My main interests in life are street photography, underground music, weightlifting, and Modern philosophy. Photography and music have helped me come to grips with the fact that I am both a mere object in the world, subject to the constraints of space and time, and also an indivisible point through which the world is experienced. That harsh reality is probably triggered by reading Modern philosophy in the first place.

	    		<p>
	    		I earned my BA at St. John's College in Santa Fe, NM. It is an institution where all students take the same required curriculum based on the Great Books program over the course of four years. Classes are conducted as seminar discussions of about 15 students.

	    		You should know about a quirk of mine. I struggle staying in one place for too long. This results in me changing work locations around my apartment or office every two hours or so. This inability to stay still plays itself out in other ways as well. Every weekend I walk for several miles in no particular direction. This is where the majority of my photographs are taken. So please don't be offended if I look uncomfortable when we are speaking. I just naturally fidget.
