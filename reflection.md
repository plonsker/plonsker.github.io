###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Through this exercise and my research, I learned that I could round off borders to give elements
a less boxy feel when on the page. I did this for the header and most of the body, as well as applying it to any
embedded images. The intended effect was to make it seem as if the elements were freely floating on the page.

For padding and margins, I discovered that I could implement specfic dimensions to only a few areas and still get the effect I was looking for from my previous wireframe. Most of my elements were fine in static positions, and applying just a bit of padding to some text areas and some margins to the images left enough room to keep things somewhat aesthetically pleasing. 

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?

 Getting carried away with positioning could result in many things impacting each other in negative ways. In my blog 
 section, I was hoping to get a little more creative by floating the navigation bar to the right in a spearate column, 
 but due to how I had timeboxed myself as well as the realization that the layout itself could ultimately be way too 
 confusing, I returned to my previous navigation setup. At times I would get so obsessed with one side of an object 
 that I would not realize that another attribute of it was what was causing it to misaligned. Although I was able to 
 actualize my previous wireframe, ultimately I wish I had budgeted my time better with positioning to achieve a cooler 
 visual experience for the page. I wsih I could start all over again, but I know I will have plenty of time to fool
 around with CSS more. For now I will take my lessons from this early web-2.0 vibe. 

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
After CSS positioning, the most difficult to implement aspects were likely the fonts and gradients. Once I did some 
proper research though the fixes could be quickly implemented. Google Fonts and the Mozilla database were extremely 
helpful. Rounding off the bordering was a bit tricky as well, as I tried to go for a look that didn't seem too 
exageratted. The general CSS coloring and addings HTML5 elements were the easiest and almost came naturally from the 
previous lessons. 


###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Probably the most helpful thing I learned was changing the gradient of elements. The most obvious implementation
of gradient changing on my site is in the header. I would like to go further the effect, perhaps change the opacity of elements with their own background images. It got me thinking about just how much developers use funky CSS techniques or whether they get around certain issues by just embedding images they altered in photoshop. The concept makes me want to start investigating certain sites and pinpointing particular elements to see just how those developers got the desired result.
